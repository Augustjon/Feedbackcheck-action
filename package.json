  "description": "This is a github action that can be used in the KTH DD2482 course DevOps. The actions checks if feedback is given in readme in a specific path in the devops course repo structure. The action will check that the feedback given fullfills the requirements. When people in the KTH course DevOps give feedback to their fellow students, that feedback has to pass certain requirements. We have focused on 2 of these requirements:  1. The feedback is substantiated meaning that the word count is at least 500 words, and if the word count is above 1000 then the feedback is considered remarkable. The Github Action uses input variables so that the limits can be modified in future course offerings as required.  2. The feedback should be submited 4 days before the submission deadline of the task. As this deadline might also be subject to change in future course offerings we decided to let the course administration set the deadline for the **feedback** as an input to the Github Action.",
